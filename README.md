# AI-Based Grade Prediction Project

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict student grades based on various performance indicators.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets
- `models/`: Stores trained machine learning models
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing and model training
- `app/`: Streamlit web application for grade predictions
- `tests/`: Unit tests for project components

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Pipeline
```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```

### Running Streamlit App
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

## Key Components
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Selection
- Neural Network Regression
- Web Application Deployment

## Customization
Modify `run_pipeline.py` to adapt to your specific dataset and requirements.

## Model Evaluation
The pipeline provides:
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (R2) Score
